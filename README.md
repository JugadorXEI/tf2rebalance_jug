# Rebalanced Fortress 2
This plugin allows you, through a file, to modify the attributes of (almost) very item in Team Fortress 2, including weapons, shields or even hats! If you think an item deserves more of the spotlight, or if you think a weapon is horribly broken, you will be able to change the attributes of such weapon to your heart's content. In addition, it's possible to add information related to those changes to let everyone know about what was changed. 

## Dependencies
- TF2Items: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=115100
- TF2Attributes (optional, for classes): https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=210221
- Morecolors (only to compile the plugin): https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=185016

## Installation
This assumes you have SourceMod installed on your dedicated server. If not, go here: https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod

1. Please install TF2Items (and optionally TF2Attributes) and follow their respective installation instructions in order to use the plugin. 
2. Get the latest release from the releases tab.
3. Drag'n'drop the addons folder to your addons folder which contains SourceMod in it.
4. Load the plugin manually (`sm plugins load tf2rebalance_jug` on the server console) or change the map on your server so the plugin loads.
5. Done!

Enjoy!
